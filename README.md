## 🚀 About Me

My core background is in sales.

I understand how businesses think, how decisions are made, and what truly creates value for customers.

To stay ahead in a rapidly evolving market, I am building a solid understanding of AI-driven automation and digital systems — not to become a full-time developer, but to better understand, position and sell complex technological solutions.

Modern B2B sales is no longer just about relationships.

It is about:
- Understanding technical products
- Translating complexity into business value
- Identifying automation potential
- Positioning AI solutions strategically

I am building hands-on experience with workflow automation and AI systems to strengthen my technical communication and consulting capabilities.
